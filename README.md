# swing-cities
This project estimated the size of West Coast Swing (WCS) communities in major European cities by scraping the total number of members in local WCS groups on Facebook.

The scripts do the following:

- 01_city-geodata: gets the geodata of major European cities from Wikipedia  
- 02_wcs-members: scrapes the number of members of public WCS groups on Facebook in the given cities  
- 03_map: visualizes the group sizes on a map

Interactive visualization of the results is available here: https://public.tableau.com/views/2022-01-06_WCS-cities/Sheet3?:language=en-GB&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link
